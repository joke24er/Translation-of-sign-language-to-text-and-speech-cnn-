The model was trained on a simple CNN architecture and AlexNet . The dataset comprises of images captured with yellow gloves on in order to isolate the gestures completely from the background. Overfitting to some degree was observed. This is a sample implementation 


-1) run the ipython notebook with your custom dataset

-2)Download the trained model

-3)Trained model is called in either in either of the files model classification on still threshold img.py or realtime video feed classification

-4)keep everything in the same directory
